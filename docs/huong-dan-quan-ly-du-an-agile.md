- Customer feedback drives development
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach
- Show don't tell mentality

Example: Grab's rapid iteration cycle in Vietnam market

3. Customer Collaboration > Contract Negotiation
Vietnamese Business Culture:
- Long-term relationship building
- Flexible scoping based on changing needs

1. Visualize the Workflow
Board Setup:
Columns: Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done
Swimlanes: By priority, team member, or work type
Card Details: Title, description, assignee, due date
Color Coding: By work type, priority, or team

Vietnam Office Implementation:
- Physical boards for co-located teams
- Digital boards for remote/hybrid work
- Cultural considerations for transparency
- Language preferences for card content
- Integration với existing tools

2. Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
WIP Limits Purpose:
- Prevent multitasking
- Identify bottlenecks
- Improve flow efficiency
- Reduce cycle time
- Increase quality

Setting WIP Limits:
- Start conservative (team size - 1)
- Monitor và adjust based on data
- Different limits for different columns
- Team agreement on limits
- Regular review và optimization
```

**Kanban Metrics:**

```
Lead Time: Customer request to delivery
Cycle Time: Start work to completion
Throughput: Items completed per time period
Work in Progress: Items currently being worked

Calculation Examples:
Lead Time = 15 days average
Cycle Time = 8 days average
Throughput = 12 items per week
WIP = 6 items currently in progress

Vietnam Business Application:
Manufacturing: Track production flow efficiency
Services: Monitor service delivery times
IT: Measure development và deployment speed
Government: Track citizen service processing times
```

### 3.2. Flow Optimization

**Identifying Bottlenecks:**

```
Flow Analysis Methods:
Cumulative Flow Diagram:

- Highlights flow problems

Value Stream Mapping:
- End-to-end process visualization
- Identify value-added và waste activities
- Measure processing và wait times
- Design future state improvements

Little's Law Application:
Average Lead Time = Average WIP / Average Throughput
Use to predict delivery times và capacity planning

Vietnam Manufacturing Example:
Current State: 50 items WIP, 5 items/day throughput
Lead Time = 50/5 = 10 days average
Target State: 25 items WIP, 5 items/day throughput
New Lead Time = 25/5 = 5 days average
```
